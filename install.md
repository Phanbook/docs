## Installation
Phanbook is built on the lightning fast PHP framework called Phalcon.
Implemented as a PHP extension, Phalcon offers dramatically better performance
and lower overhead than other PHP frameworks.  Installing Phalcon is easy but
does require that you have root access to your system.  Installation of Phalcon
is documented
[here](https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/install.html).
### System Requirements

There are a few things that you will need to have set up in order to run
Phanbook:

- A web server: Apache (with mod_rewrite) or Nginx
- PHP 5.5+ with the following extensions:
[phalcon](https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/install.html),
mbstring, pdo_mysql, openssl, json, gd, dom, fileinfo
- Mysql or MariaDB
- SSH (command-line) access

1. Install via [Vagrant](http://phanbook.com/docs/vagrant)
2. Install via [Docker](http://phanbook.com/docs/docker)
